Personal Recipe Library
-----------------------

Task 
-----------
A simple web application that utilises all/most modules covered in the 8 week Nationwide/QA bootcamp training.

Web Application (Idea)
-----------
I created a simple personal recipe library that utilies the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionalities.

I wanted to create an environment where the user is able to simply make use of the CRUD functionalities without anything distracting and therefore trying to be accessible to all ages and/or disabilities.

Web Application (Creation)
-----------
Step 1: Creation of Trello Boards
    - I wanted to understand and paint a picture of what I wanted to see on the website
    - I created a product backlog which outlines possible routes for website creation

Step 2: Creation of website wireframes
    - Using 'mockflow' for wireframe drawing I was able to visualise what I wanted to implement from the product backlog

Step 3: Research stage
The following technologies was used in the creating of the website:
    - Backend: Java / Spring boot
        -> By using the reference architecture, I was able to implement my logic. See 'backend' folder.

    - Datebase: mySQL
        -> This was (in my opinion) the easiest to implement into my website after trying with H2 SQL and failing multiple times in trying to save locally.

    - Frontend: HTML / JS / CSS
        -> I was most comfortable with the combination of the above technologies. This was the main combination used in the 'frontend week'

The combination of technologies used to create the backend, frontend and database aided me in building a full-stack application.

Step 4.1: Simple Backend
    - By implementing the reference architecture into my work, I was able to produce a fully working and connected backend to my database. See 'backend' folder.
