Personal Recipe Library
-----------------------

Task 
-----------
A simple web application that utilises all/most modules covered in the 8 week Nationwide/QA bootcamp training.

Web Application (Idea)
-----------
I created a simple personal recipe library that utilies the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionalities.

I wanted to create an environment where the user is able to simply make use of the CRUD functionalities without anything distracting and therefore trying to be accessible to all ages and/or disabilities.

Web Application (Creation)
-----------
Step 1: Creation of Trello Boards

    - I wanted to understand and paint a picture of what I wanted to see on the website

    - I created a product backlog which outlines possible routes for website creation

Step 2: Creation of website wireframes

    - Using 'mockflow' for wireframe drawing I was able to visualise what I wanted to implement from the product backlog


Step 3: Research stage

The following technologies was used in the creating of the website:

    - Backend: Java / Spring boot

        -> By using the reference architecture, I was able to implement my logic. See 'backend' folder.

    - Datebase: mySQL (through XAMPP)

        -> This was (in my opinion) the easiest to implement into my website after trying with H2 SQL and failing multiple times in trying to save locally.

    - Frontend: HTML / JS / CSS

        -> I was most comfortable with the combination of the above technologies. This was the main combination used in the 'frontend week'


The combination of technologies used to create the backend, frontend and database aided me in building a full-stack application.


Step 4: Creation Stage (Part 1)

    - Database Structure

    - Working backend

    - All stages are working in tandem with each other (CRUD) [see 'Step 5']

Step 5: Testing (Part 1)

    - Install client to test API (Postman was used)

    - Tested all CRUD functionalities to work as expected


Step 6: Creation Stage (Part 2)

    - Using the wireframes as a tool, I implemented the desired layout including:

        -> Routing mechanism around the website

        -> Implementation of CRUD in frontend


Step 7: Testing (Part 2)

    - Checking full app, API and database functionality


Conclusion
-----------

Highs:

    - I was successful in implementing CRUD functionalities
    - Was able to create a simple but useful website

Lows:

    - I didnt meet all the criteria set out in the product backlog
        -> This includes a search bar, uploading of images and a login page
        -> I was over ambitious at the start and therefore wasn't realistic in my approach

    - I intially set out to create a website that could be accessible to all ages and disabilities however, from recent feedback the nav bar I used may be hard to use for the older generation
